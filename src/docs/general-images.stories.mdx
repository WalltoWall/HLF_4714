# Images

Best practices and usage patterns when working with images in Prismic.

## Image Sizing

Content displayed on the site is managed through Slices. Each slice document
explains image size guidelines.

Prismic will automatically resize your images to a size suitable for the
visitors device. If you upload a 4000x3000 pixel image, for example, Prismic
will automatically resize it to the size of the image on the site.

In general, upload the largest resolution image you have even if the image is
only used in a smaller size.

> ## ðŸš§ File size limitation
>
> Prismic has a 10 MB file upload limit for images. While the dimensions of your
> image can be larger than what the site needs, it must be under 10 MB.

If you need to resize your images due to Prismic's file size limitation, we
recommended utilizing the Image Resizer application to compress and resize your
images before uploading them to Prismic. The **Large** size will work best.

For details on installing the Image Resizer app, please refer to the
[Image Resizer](/admin/guides/general/images) guide.

## ADA Compliance

When adding new images, you must add alternative text descriptions (a.k.a. alt
text) to all images in order to maintain ADA Compliance.

For more information on maintaining an accessible webpage, please see the
[ADA Compliance](/admin/guides/general/accessibility-ada-compliance) guide.
