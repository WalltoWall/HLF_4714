The Image Resizer app is a simple image resizer with limited options. Just drop
images into the app and it outputs a smaller version of it.

## How to use

Resizing images is as simple as:

1. Open the app.
1. Drag images on to the window.
1. Click the **Resize** button.

Your resized images will appear in your **Downloads** folder.

## Installation

First, download the Image Resizer application with one of the following links:

- [Image Resizer for Windows](https://github.com/asyarb/ImageResizer/releases/download/v1.2.0/image-resizer-setup-1.2.0.exe)
- [Image Resizer for macOS](https://github.com/asyarb/ImageResizer/releases/download/v1.2.0/ImageResizer-1.2.0.dmg)

Then follow the instructions appropriate for your platform:

### macOS

1. Open the **.dmg** file from the download link above. Once the .dmg opens, you
   should see the following window:

   <img src={macDrag} />

2. Drag the **ImageResizer** icon into the **Applications** folder.
3. After a short delay, the ImageResizer app should successfully install.
4. Open your **Applications** folder normally and click on the newly added
   ImageResizer icon. You will see the following window:

   <img src={macNoAllow} />

5. This is a temporary beta bug, so click on **OK** for now.
6. Using the same ImageResizer icon you clicked in step 4, right click the icon
   and click **Open**. You should now see a slightly different window:

   <img src={macWarning} />

Note that right clicking the icon is only necessary the first time you open it.
All subsequent app launches can be done normally.

7. Click on **Open** and the Image Resizer app should open!

### Windows

1. Download the **.exe** from the link above. In some browsers, you may receive
   a warning like shown below:

   <img src={chromeWarning} />

2. This is a temporary beta bug. Click on the down arrow and select **Keep**.
3. Once the .exe finishes downloading, click on it (or run it from your
   downloads folder) to install the app. You may see the following:

   <img src={windowsSmartscreen} />

4. This is a **beta bug**. Click on the More Info text then click **Run
   anyway**.
5. A small window with an installation progress bar will appear. Once it
   completes, the ImageResizer app should launch!
