# Layout-First Approach

Learn how to keep a consistent design throughout the site.

## Overview

This site has been designed and developed with the direct involvement of a
designer. The designer ensures the visual elements of the site are consistent
throughout pages while also being flexible enough to allow the site to grow.

Here are some strategies you can employ to keep the site looking as fresh and
visually appealing as it did the day it launched.

## Stick to designer-approved layouts

The designs listed in [Layouts](/admin/layouts/) have been designed to have an
ideal balance between text content, imagery, and a visitor's attention span.

We recommend using one of these layouts whenever a new page has to be created.

## Branch off layouts when necessary

The existing layouts may not be an ideal fit for new types of content that did
not exist at the website's launch. In these cases, we recommend starting with an
existing layout and adding Slices where necessary.

Be cognizant of the overal appearance of the page.

## Slices: with great power comes great responsibility

Slices are powerful building blocks that allow you to quickly construct new
pages. The site is built to ensure the site can grow over time in a scalable
way. Rather than being stuck to a rigid template, Slices allow you to compose
pages that were not in the site's original scope.

With this great power comes great responsibility. Not every combination of Slice
will look visually appealing or function well.

## Design checklist

When deviating from the designer-approved layouts, ask yourself the following
questions:

- Is there an alternative way to structure my content using an existing layout?
- Do the designs of the Slices flow together?
- Is there too much text in one area? Too much imagery?
- Will the order of my content make sense to visitors?
- Is there a clear purpose to the page?

The overall design and impression users have is dependent on your ability to
create visually appealing pages with suitable content. Asking yourself these
questions should help you structure pages in the same way we designed the
layouts.
