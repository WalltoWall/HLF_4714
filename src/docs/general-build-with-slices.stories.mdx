# Build Pages With Slices

An introduction to constructing pages with Slices, the reusable building blocks
of Prismic.

## Overview

Slices are configurable blocks of content with a predefined look and feel. All
pages are made using these building blocks to ensure each page stays within with
the overall design language of the site.

Content editors do not need to know how to code to create well-designed pages.
Instead, Slices contain a preset collection of fields that allow the page author
to customize the content and media displayed.

A Page can contain any number of Slices in any order. General layout
recommendations can be found in the [layouts](/admin/layouts/) of this site.

## Example of Slices in a Page

A hypothetical product page could be made with the following slices:

1. **Hero Image** - Quick visual introduction to the product.
2. **Text** - Text content describing the product.
3. **Images** - Collection of product images.
4. **Text** - Additional product information.
5. **Call to Action** - Link to sign up for the product or to get more
   information.

Additional slices could be inserted anywhere within that list. The surrounding
slices will move around as necessary.

## Layout-first approach

When build pages with slices, we recommend keeping the overall design of the
site front-of-mind. See the following document for some design-oriented
strategies you can use while editing content.
