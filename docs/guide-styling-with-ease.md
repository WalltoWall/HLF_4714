# Styling with Ease

Wall-to-Wall Gatsby projects have selected [`calico`][calico] as its preferred
CSS-in-JS solution because it:

-   Enforces consistency with an explicit global `theme`.
-   Enables developers to implement and respond design requirements quickly.
-   Has great performance thanks to static extraction.
-   Is 100% type-safe.
-   Remove the difficulties and burden of CSS with its functional/atomic
    approach.

As a quick example, instead of needing to write something like this:

```css
.card {
	font-size: 16px;
	width: 100%;
	background-color: red;
}

.card--green {
	background-color: green;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 40em) {
	.card {
		font-size: 20px;
		width: 50%;
	}
}

@media screen and (min-width: 52em) {
	.card {
		font-size: 24px;
	}
}
```

```jsx
const Card = ({ isGreen }) => {
	return <div className={clsx('card', isGreen && 'card--green')} />
}
```

We can just write following:

```jsx
const Card = ({ isGreen }) => {
	return (
		<Box
			styles={{
				backgroundColor: isGreen ? 'red' : 'green',
				fontSize: [16, 20, 24],
				width: ['100%', '50%'],
			}}
		/>
	)
}
```

With `calico`, component styles are achieved by applying pre-existing classes
via a syntax that is similar to "just writing CSS" — without writing a single
line of custom CSS.

Once you've actually built something this way, you'll quickly notice some real
benefits:

-   **You aren't spending energy inventing class names.** No more adding silly
    names or styled-components like `.sidebar__inner-wrapper` or
    `<SidebarInnerWrapper />` just to style something, and no more agonizing
    over the perfect abstract name for something that's just a flex container.
-   **Your CSS stops growing**. Using a traditional approach, your CSS files get
    bigger _every time_ you add a new feature. With atomic CSS, all of your
    styles are reusable so you rarely need to write new CSS.
-   **Your CSS stays performant**. In a more traditional CSS-in-JS library,
    instead of paying in the cost of CSS size, you pay with the added runtime
    cost of every single component you style. While `calico` still has a
    runtime, it is much lighter than alternative libraries.
-   **Making changes feels safe**. CSS is global and you can never know what
    you're breaking when making a change. Styles in your components are local,
    so you can change them without breaking something else.

For more information on using `calico` in a project, refer to its
