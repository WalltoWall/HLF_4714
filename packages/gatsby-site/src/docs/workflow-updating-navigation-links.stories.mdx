# Updating Navigation Links

How to add, remove, or change header and footer navigation links.

## Navigation Documents

The navigation links in the header and footer are managed using a
[Navigation Document](/admin/types/bf1497c7-6903-54c4-ad33-b00d1cbde1eb/) named
"Primary".

Changing the names and URLs of these links will automatically update the header,
footer, and mobile navigation menus.

Due to the specific design of these parts of the site, we recommend keeping the
list to a **maximum of three links**.

## Creating new navigation lists

The site does not use navigation lists anywhere else on the site so Prismic does
not allow creating new Navigation documents.

If you need to link to additional pages, you can add links to the following
Slices on pages:

- [Section Header](/admin/slices/dc006611-69d4-5acb-ae4e-d459d191f535/)
- [Content with Image](/admin/slices/7839bf96-e973-5842-9cb6-ff61fed98583/)
