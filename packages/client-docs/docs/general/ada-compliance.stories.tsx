        In order to maintain an accessible website, content editors must ensure
        that their changes do not accidentally discriminate against or exclude
        people with disabilities. This article will provide Wall-to-Wall's
        recommended best practices for website accessibility and maintaining ADA
        compliance.

        <p>
          <em>Note:</em> The internet and ADA compliance are fluid standards, so
          these guidelines may not currently encompass new developments or
          technologies. Additional breakdowns of specific guidelines can be
          found in WCAG, a set of accessibility standards determined by the
          World Wide Web Consortium.

      <h2>Image Alt Text</h2>
      <p>
        When adding new images to the Media Library, always remember to enter a
        summarized description of the image. Descriptions allow screen reader
        users to glean the intent of images on a page.
      </p>
      <img src={altTextExample} alt="" />
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>Image Text:</em> If the image you are adding contains text and
          that text is required to convey the meaning of the image to the
          reader, then the alt text must contain **all** the text in the image.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Color Contrast</h2>
      <p>
        Make sure that your visuals have enough contrast and color to be easily
        identifiable and distinguishable. This requirement isnâ€™t very intensive,
        but when uploading new media, be sure that your image is clear and that
        text has enough contrast to be easily legible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the documentation for individual slices, the{' '}
        <strong>Recommendations</strong> sections will let you know if there are
        contrast considerations when selecting an image or text color.
