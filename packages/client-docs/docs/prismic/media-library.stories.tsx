      <h2>Supported Files</h2>
      <p>
        Media such as images and PDF files can be uploaded to Prismic to serve
        on the website. If the file is very large, such as video files, we
        recommend uploading to a specialized service and integrating it into the
        site.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
